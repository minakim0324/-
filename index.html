<p>Wired Equivalent Privacy ( English : Wired Equivalent Privacy, WEP ) is a wireless LAN , which defines the standard IEEE 802.11 is used for wireless LAN security between operating as part of the protocol algorithm is. [1] WEP, which was introduced in the 802.11 standard revised in 1997, was created to provide data security similar to that of a traditional wired network. WEP, which uses a 10- or 26-digit hexadecimal key value, was once very common and was the first option in router security settings.

In early 2001, cryptographers discovered several critical vulnerabilities, which could be used to crack WEP connections in a matter of tens of minutes using software available to anyone. [2] Within months of the discovery of the vulnerability, the IEEE formed an 802.11i team to address it. In 2003, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that WEP was replaced by Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA ). In the 802.11i standard released in 2004, the IEEE declared that both WEP-40 and WEP-104 were deprecated. [3]</p>
